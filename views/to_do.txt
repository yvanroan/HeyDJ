next thing here is to be able to communicate with my database. 
like being able to add the users,djs, songs and request to my db.
being able to communicate pull and push to the db in real time.

i created a fetch function which will update the website each time we make 
a change to the db. still need to finish it tho, not everything is updated
yet. the stack, the history are not updated.

if we remove or play a request, hte status should go to True
we can try adding the ids of the dj and song, turn it into a number and
compare it with the ones we have previously stored to find if the song has been
sent by another user before. 

why not make a poll after to see which song were the most requested after the party
would be pretty easy actually
